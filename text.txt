Python Newspaper Module
Most of us are often not interested in reading the complete newspaper or even a complete article. In such cases, we only want to know about keywords, titles, or many such smaller things of the article so that we don't have to spend so much reading a complete article. This also becomes useful when we only want to read selected articles, but we don't know how we can select useful articles for us. We all must be aware of what web scraping is and how it works. We also know that how much web scrapping is important and how it is helpful for us to extract all the useful information from a source website. We can also perform this operation on the newspaper websites too from where we can take a link of an article and scrap and curate useful information from that article. It is possible for us to perform all this by using a Python program, and for this task, Python provides us with a very useful module, i.e., Newspaper Module. We are going to learn about this Newspaper Module of Python in this tutorial, and we will learn how we can use this module to perform newspaper scrapping and curation using a Python program.

Newspaper Module in Python
Newspaper in a Python Module, which is basically designed to curate useful information from a newspaper article. Therefore, we can use Python's Newspaper Module to perform scrapping and curation from an article by problem its web link in the Python program. We can retrieve all the useful information from an article, such as title, keywords, etc., by using the functions of the Newspaper Module. The newspaper Module of Python uses advanced algorithms with web scrapping features so that all the useful text can be extracted from a newspaper website. The Newspaper Module works very amazingly on the online newspaper websites we generally use in our daily life.
